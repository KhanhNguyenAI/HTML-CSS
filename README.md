# ðŸ’«About SOLID :
S â€” Single Responsibility Principle
A class should have only one reason to change.
âž¡ Each class or module should be responsible for only one functionality or purpose.

O â€” Open/Closed Principle
Software entities (classes, modules, functions) should be open for extension but closed for modification.
âž¡ You should be able to add new behavior without changing existing code.

L â€” Liskov Substitution Principle
Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without breaking the application.
âž¡ Subclasses must behave in a way that the program using the superclass still works properly.

I â€” Interface Segregation Principle
Clients should not be forced to depend on methods they do not use.
âž¡ It's better to have multiple small and specific interfaces than a large, general-purpose one.

D â€” Dependency Inversion Principle
High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
âž¡ Abstractions should not depend on details; details should depend on abstractions.
